The migration tool for [Invenio](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio) does not generate records compatible with last version of [Zenodo](https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo) and they cannot be imported.
This tool allows to generate a Zenodo compatible json from the markdown.

The majority of the code in this tool is from Invenio project
